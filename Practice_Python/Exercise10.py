This weekâ€™s exercise is going to be revisiting an old exercise,
except require the solution in a different way.

Take two lists, say for example these two:
	a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
	b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates).
Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

Extra:
1. Randomly generate two lists to test this

b = random.sample(range(1,30), 16)
result_overlaps = [i for i in set(a) if i in b]
result = [i for i in result_overlaps if result_overlaps.count(i) == 1]
